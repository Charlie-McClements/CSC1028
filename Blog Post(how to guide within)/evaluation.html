				<h1>Evaluating the Simulation So Far</h1>
			</div>
			<div class = "text">
				Based off the work that has been done as of writing this, how well
                does the simulation achieve the initial goals. How close is it to
                achieving the goals that it hasn't yet achieved and how expandable
                is the program to build upon it in order to work towards fulfilling
                all of the goals and more.

					<div class="text" >
                        <h2 style="text-align:left">Have the simulation be customised to individual farms quickly and easily</h2>
						The simulation currently has all of the data specific to an individual farm stored within the data.js
                        file. This file can very quickly be swapped out for a different file containing details about a different
                        farm in order to run the simulation on a completely different farm. However the writing of the data.js file
                        itself is not particularly fast to do. So, although the simulation achieves the goal well, it may be beneficial
                        to have a second program which aids the writing of the data.js file to make it faster and easier to generate these
                        files.

					<div class="text">
                        <h2 style="text-align:left">Have the simulation be able to replicate past real world results with a small error margin</h2>
						As discussed previously, the data used within the simulation has not yet been fitted to real world data. Meaning that the
                        results produced by the simulation aren't close to real world results. However, I believe as the simulation has alot of functionality
                        in place, the process of fitting the data will be rather simple and therefore this goal is very close to being ticked off the list.

                        <h2 style="text-align:left">Have all events within the simulation occur for a reason or be triggered by another entity</h2>
						Currently within the simulation there aren't any events that aren't triggered by an entity (cow or employee), with the exception
                        of grass growing, which is triggered by a new day. Therefore this goal is accomplished well by the simulation and can be noted as,
                        in my opinion, successful.

                        <h2 style="text-align:left">Have the end product be able to easily compare two different results from the simulation,
                            before and after a change that you make.</h2>
                            The simulation's randomness is currently influenced by a set seed within the simulation. Therefore any two results
                            can be compared knowing for a fact that the output is only different due to a change in variables, not a change in
                            randomness. Therefore two outputs from the simulation can be compared like for like. The output of the simulation is
                            displayed graphically in a browser. Therefore, by having two windows side by side, results can very quickly be compared
                            by looking at the two different graphs side by side.

                Of the initial four goals, three have been successfully achieved as of writing this post. Although 3/4 sounds like the project is
                only half complete, as has been discussed above, the other two goals are very close to being achieved. Therefore I do believe that,
                it may not be there yet, however the project is very close to being successful in it's initial goals.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                The conclusion could be drawn that the project is very close to being, but not yet, successful. However the scope of a project like
                this may only expand. The more accurate the project becomes the more useful it will become to the everyday farm owner. Therefore in
                order for it to be useful as well as successful more features should be added to continue improving the accuracy of the simulation,
                as well as some more comfort features. The project has a long way to go before it could be used commercially but there are good foundations
                in place for the broader goals discussed to be developed and eventually make the simulation commercially useful.
