        <div class="text">
            Having seen exactly what the simulation can do,
            we can now start to look towards the future and what can be added to the project beyond
            that in order to make the simulation much more useful and successful.

        <div class="text">
            <h2>Data Fitting</h2>
            As described in the how to guide's accuracy section, I intend to
            fit the variables within the simulation in order to make the data
            outputted by the simulation much more accurate. This will hopefully
            result in a simulation which can reproduce real world results consistently.
            This should bring the project alot closer to achieving an initial goal of
            having a simulation which can replicate real world results with a small
            margin for error. Although I have made a small start on this, progress so
            far has been minimal and not particularly successful. Therefore a fresh start
            may be the easiest way to continue with this goal.

                    Currently within the simulation the cost of machinery is based off an average calculation
                    for farmers in England's yearly costs per acre. Although this does provide a figure which
                    isn't absurd, it is not particularly accurate. In order to make this better a list of the
                    machinery that a farm has should be added to the data.js file. This list should have every
                    machine on the farm and the value of said machine. The depreciation can then be accurately
                    calculated with this.

                    You would also have to add an estimate of fuel usage to each function where appropriate and

                    <h2 style="text-align:left">Feeding Meal</h2>
                    In beef farms it is a common practice to feed meal to calves and stock near to finishing age in
                    order to get them closer to the desired weight faster. This is a large expense for the farm as it
                    requires buying in meal. However it's benefits seem to mostly outweigh it's drawbacks and as it is
                    such common practice it should be included in the simulation. In order to include this in the
                    simulation
                    a function would be required to provide the meal to only certain groups of cows.

                    A simple loop through
                    all cows checking if they meet the age criteria for feeding meal to calves and the cull and age
                    criteria
                    for finishing stock could be easily implemented. However the cow_tick function would need to be
                    altered
                    in order to accomodate the addition of meal. If the meal is present for that cow to eat it should be
                    taken
                    into account for weight gained etc.

            Due to the sheer complexity of a beef farm the scope for additional events being included within the
            simulation
            is almost limitless. I have detailed a few above however the only limiting factor is your time. The more you
            can add to the simulation the more accurate it will be and therefore the more useful. However, do note that
            with
            any major changes to the simulation, e.g. the addition of feeding meal to finishing stock, the data would
            need
            to be fitted again in order to maintain the accuracy of the simulation.
