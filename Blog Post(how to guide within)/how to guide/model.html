				<h1>System Modelling</h1>
			</div>
			<div class = "text">
				When talking about the system we are referring to the farm's buisness
				and all of the variables which have an effect on the buisness.
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class = "col">   
					<div class="text" >
						Ideally our system model would include all the variables that can possibly
						effect the farm. Unfortunately this is not a practical approach as the number
						of variables is far too large. Therefore we need to narrow the scope slightly.
						For our simulation we are primarily wanting to simulate the money gained or lost
						by the farm. Therefore instead of looking at all the variables that can affect every
						aspect of the farm, we only look at the variables that affect the income and expenses
						of the farm.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<div class="text">
						With our scope narrowed down we still have a large number of variables. Therefore
						we should look to focus on the most influential of the variables and events and start from there.
						For our model I used a data analysis paper written on a beef farm. This gives you a long list
						of events and the reasons why such an event may be triggered and the effect of such an event.
						Out of this list we can select the ones that impact the earnings of the farm the most.
						And now we have a starting point on which we can base our simulation.

				Another useful source of information asides from a relevant data analysis paper is a paper written
				in the Newzealand Journal of Agricultural Research (found in useful links above). This documents in detail how you can go about
				creating a system model for a farm. Although it describes a much higher level apporach than a data analysis report
				as it is much more theoretical it can help you to make decisions as to what is necessary if a data analysis paper isn't 
				available or isn't enough to go on.
			</div>
			<img class="fullimage" src="../images/system model.png" alt = "flow chart of the system">
			<div class="text">
				With our starting point we can then start to map the important events onto a flow chart,
				a basic example is shown above. This flow chart when complete can give an idea of the causes of an event
				occuring and what variables should change when that event occurs. This flow chart can then act
				as the sudo code for your program. Which we will look at in the next section.
