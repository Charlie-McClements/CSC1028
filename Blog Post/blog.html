				For my project for this module I choose to simulate an industry, in particular the farming
                industry. Having grown up and living on a beef farm it seemed like a natural choice for a
                project that I felt I could have good background knowledge on and a large interest in.

            <div class="row">
				<div class = "col">   
					<div class="text" >
                        <h2 style="text-align:left">Success</h2>
						In order for this project to be successful it has to be able to replicate real world
                        results on a farm in a computer simulation. In order to achieve this the simulation
                        should be able to act as a digital clone of a farming buisness. In particular a beef
                        farm.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<div class="text">
						Naturally, the scope of the project has to be limited as time for the module is limited.
                        This means that some more specific goals should be noted that I should aim towards in 
                        order to ensure I have a successful simulation together within the time frame.

            <div class="text">
                <h2 style="text-align:left">The Goals:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have the simulation be customised to individual farms quickly and easily</li>
                    <li>Have the simulation be able to replicate past real world results with a small error margin</li>
                    <li>Have all events within the simulation occur for a reason or be triggered by another entity</li>
                    <li>Have the end product be able to easily compare two different results from the simulation,
                        before and after a change that you make.</li>
